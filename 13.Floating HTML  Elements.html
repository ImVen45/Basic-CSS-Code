                    Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky remnants 
left over from the early formation of the solar system about 
4.6 billion years ago. Most of this ancient space rubble can be 
found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main 
asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Ceres — the largest 
at about 950 kilometers (590 miles) in diameter and also identified as a dwarf planet — to bodies that are less than 1 kilometer 
(0.6 mile) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is 
less than that of Earth’s Moon.Most asteroids are irregularly shaped, though a few are nearly 
spherical, and they are often pitted or cratered. As they revolve 
around the Sun in elliptical orbits, the asteroids also rotate, 
sometimes quite erratically, tumbling as they go. More than 150 
asteroids are known to have a small companion moon (some 
have two moons). There are also binary (double) asteroids, in 
which two rocky bodies of roughly equal size orbit each other, as 
well as triple asteroid systems.

                    “Shooting stars,” or meteors, are bits of interplanetary material 
falling through Earth’s atmosphere and heated to incandescence 
by friction. These objects are called meteoroids as they are hurtling through space, becoming meteors for the few seconds they 
streak across the sky and create glowing trails.Several meteors per hour can usually be seen on any given 
night. Sometimes the number increases dramatically — these 
events are termed meteor showers. Some occur annually or at 
regular intervals as the Earth passes through the trail of dusty 
debris left by a comet. Meteor showers are usually named after 
a star or constellation that is close to where the meteors appear 
in the sky. Perhaps the most famous are the Perseids, which 
peak around August 12 every year. Every Perseid meteor is a tiny 
piece of the comet Swift–Tuttle, which swings by the Sun every 
135 years. Other meteor showers and their associated comets 
are the Leonids (Tempel–Tuttle), the Aquarids and Orionids (Halley), and the Taurids (Encke). Most comet dust in meteor showers burns up in the atmosphere before reaching the ground; 
some dust is captured by high-altitude aircraft and analyzed in 
NASA laboratories.
