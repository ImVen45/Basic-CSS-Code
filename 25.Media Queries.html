                <p>
                Jupiter is the largest and most massive planet in our solar system, containing more than twice the
                amount of material of the
                other bodies orbiting our Sun combined. Most of the material
                left over after the formation of the Sun went to Jupiter, forming a
                type of planet called a gas giant.
                Jupiter’s appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and
                spots. Most visible clouds are composed of ammonia and ammonia compounds, with unknown chemicals
                providing color.
                Jupiter’s fast rotation — spinning once every 10 hours — creates
                strong jet streams, smearing its clouds into bands across the
                planet.
                </p>
                <p>
                The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of
                clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. More
                recently, three smaller
                ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of
                its larger cousin. Scientists do not yet know if these ovals and
                planet-circling bands are shallow or deeply rooted to the interior.
                The composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere is similar to that of the
                Sun — mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere,
                pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen
                gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar
                system — an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to
                the planet’s center,
                the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off
                the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting.
                </p>
                <p>
                Jupiter’s fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in
                this region, generating the planet’s powerful magnetic field. It is
                still unclear if, deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid
                material.The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by
                Jupiter’s powerful magnetic field. It balloons 1 to 3 million kilometers (600,000 to 2 million miles)
                toward the Sun and tapers
                into a windsock-shaped tail extending more than 1 billion kilometers (600 million miles) behind Jupiter,
                as far as Saturn’s orbit.
                The magnetic field rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge. Near
                the planet, the magnetic
                field traps a swarm of charged particles and accelerates them to
                very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the
                innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.

                In total, the planet has more than
                60 moons, including several that were discovered in just the past
                few years.Jupiter’s four largest moons — Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto — were first observed by the
                astronomer Galileo Galilei in
                1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons
                are known today as the Galilean satellites. Galileo would be
                astonished at what we have learned about these moons, largely
                from the NASA mission named for him: Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system;
                Ganymede is the largest
                moon in the solar system and the only moon known to have its
                own magnetic field; and a liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen
                crust of Europa, making it
                a tempting place to explore.
