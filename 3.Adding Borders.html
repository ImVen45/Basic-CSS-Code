        <h1>Our Solar System</h1>
        <p id="first-para">
            Humans have gazed at the heavens and tried to understand the cosmos for thousands of years. Ancient civilizations placed great emphasis on careful astronomical observations. Early 
            Greek astronomers were among the first to leave a written record of their attempts to explain the cosmos. For them, the universe was Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and five glowing 
            points of light that moved among the stars. The Greeks named the five points of light — called planetes, or wanderers — after 
            their gods. The Romans later translated the names into Latin — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — and these are the 
            names astronomers use today. Planetary features are named by the International Astronomical Union, founded in 1919. For more 
            information about the names of planets, moons, and features, consult the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature website at planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov.

           Ancient observers believed that the Sun and all the other celestial bodies revolved around Earth. Astronomers gradually 
           realized that the Earth-centered model did not account for the 
           motions of the planets. In the early 17th century, Galileo Galilei’s discoveries using the recently invented telescope strongly 
           supported the concept of a “solar system” in which all the planets, including Earth, revolve around a central star — the Sun. 
           Planetary moons, the rings of Saturn, and more planets were 
           eventually discovered: Uranus (in 1781) and Neptune (1846). The 
           largest known asteroid, Ceres, was discovered between Mars 
           and Jupiter in 1801. Originally classified as a planet, Ceres is 
           now designated a dwarf planet (but retains its asteroid label), 
           along with Pluto, which was discovered in 1930; Eris, found in 
           2003; Haumea, found in 2004; and Makemake, found in 2005. 
           There may be hundreds of dwarf planets in Pluto’s realm.
