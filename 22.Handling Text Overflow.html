        <p>
            Moons — also called satellites — come in many shapes, sizes,
            and types. They are generally solid bodies, and few have atmospheres. Most of the planetary moons probably
            formed from the
            discs of gas and dust circulating around planets in the early solar
            system. Some moons are large enough for their gravity to cause
            them to be spherical, while smaller moons appear to be captured asteroids, not related to the formation and
            evolution of the
            body they orbit. The International Astronomical Union lists 146
            moons orbiting planets in our solar system — this number does
            not include the moons awaiting official recognition and naming,
            the eight moons of the dwarf planets, nor the tiny satellites that
            orbit some asteroids and other celestial objects.Of the terrestrial (rocky) planets of the inner solar
            system, neither
            Mercury nor Venus has any moons at all, Earth has one, and
            Mars has its two small moons. In the outer solar system, the gas
            giants (Jupiter, Saturn) and the ice giants (Uranus and Neptune)
            have numerous moons. As these huge planets grew in the early
            solar system, they were able to capture objects with their large
            gravitational fields.
