            Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky remnants 
left over from the early formation of the solar system about 
4.6 billion years ago. Most of this ancient space rubble can be 
found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main 
asteroid belt. Asteroids range in size from Ceres — the largest 
at about 950 kilometers (590 miles) in diameter and also identified as a dwarf planet — to bodies that are less than 1 kilometer 
(0.6 mile) across. The total mass of all the asteroids combined is 
less than that of Earth’s Moon.
