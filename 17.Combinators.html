                    <h3>Asteroids</h3>
                    <p>
                        Asteroids, sometimes called minor planets, are rocky remnants 
                        left over from the early formation of the solar system about 
                        4.6 billion years ago.

                            Most of this ancient space rubble can be found orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter within the main
                            asteroid belt.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Asteroids range in size from Ceres — the largest at about 950 kilometers (590 miles) in diameter and also
                            identified as a dwarf planet — to bodies that are less than 1 kilometer
                            (0.6 mile) across.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The total mass of all the asteroids combined is less than that of Earth’s Moon.Most asteroids are irregularly shaped, though a few are nearly 
                        spherical, and they are often pitted or cratered.
